# NEATAX: Tensorized NEAT Implementation for Parallel Hardware Accelaration

NEATAX is a powerful tool that utilizes JAX to implement the NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) algorithm. It provides support for parallel execution of tasks such as forward network computation, mutation, and crossover at the population level.

## Performance

One of the standout features of NEATAX is its speed. Compared to traditional CPU implementations, NEATAX significantly improves the efficiency of the NEAT algorithm. It has been observed to boost the running speed of the NEAT algorithm by more than 10 times, offering considerable advantage in larger-scale and time-sensitive applications.

## Installization
